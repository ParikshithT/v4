The Twitter-Data-Pipeline is a streamlined ETL tool that extracts tweets directly via the Twitter API, orchestrated by Apache Airflow running on AWS EC2. This setup ensures a smooth flow of data, which is then securely stored in AWS S3, offering a robust solution for capturing and analyzing the pulse of Twitter conversations in real-time.
