This project transforms New York City's taxi data into a dynamic narrative using GCP's suite and Python, highlighted by insights from BigQuery analysis and visualized on a Looker Studio dashboard. It navigates through the complexities of NYC's taxi trips with the Mage Data Pipeline Tool, offering an open-source platform for collaborative enhancements. This digital tapestry not only decodes urban mobility but also invites global contributions to enrich its story.
